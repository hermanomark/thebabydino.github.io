    <h2>Hire Me!</h2>
    <p>... if you're looking for someone to code or improve logos, loaders, widgets, form controls and other such small things! That's exactly what I do and I take great pride in what I produce - it's clever, clean, DRY, easily extensible and maintainable
      code.</p>
    <p>... if you're looking for someone to run a workshop on cutting edge CSS topics, clever coding, understanding SVG or even more mathy topics.</p>
    <p>However, if you're looking for someone to do animation design or any kind of design, I am not the right person. I have an Electronics and Mathematics background and absolutely no artistic sense.</p>
    <p>I also don't take on big assignments (full web pages) or assignments far in the future.</p>
    <p>If you still think you can use my services, you can <a class='link_hire' href='https://codepen.io/thebabydino/#hireme'>contact me using this form</a>. I usually answer within a day, except for the times when I take days off to go to concerts.</p>
